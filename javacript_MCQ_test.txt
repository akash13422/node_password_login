Q 10 - What will be the output of the code?

function Add(){
    console.log(answer)
    var answer = 2
};
Add();


A) 2
B) 4
C) undefined
D) Error

Ans:The above code displays undefined as an answer due to the concept of hoisting in Javascript.
In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used. This is because variable declarations using var are hoisted to the top of their functional scope at compile time. Hence, a variable can be initialized and used before it has been declared.

Q 11 - What will be the output of the code?
let dog = {
    breed: "Border Collie",
    sound: "Wooh",
    getBreed: () => { 
        return this.breed;
    },
    getSound: function() {
        return this.sound;
    }
};
console.log(dog.getBreed(), dog.getSound());

A) Border Collie, Wooh
B) Border Collie, undefined
c) undefined, Wooh 
D) undefined, undefined
CORRECT ANSWER C
The this inside an arrow function does not depend on how the function was called. Instead, they inherit the this of the parent scope. This is called "lexical scoping". In sloppy mode, this on the top level refers to the global object, so getBreed's this.breed refers to the breed property on the global object, which doesn't exist.
